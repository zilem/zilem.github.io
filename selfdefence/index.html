        someone I could work with, whose story I could see myself working on for

        bring on board long time friend Arlene Bogna as co-writer. Through our

          toil tirelessly over how to address these contemporary issues in our film.

          FOR DECADES, A toxic form of masculinity has prevailed in this world.
          This created a void of what men are supposed to be. How they are

          Some men may consider this weak. But vulnerability is not to be mistaken
          for weakness. Those who do may simply be insecure.<br>
          <br>
          We hope our audience will find it liberating to see being Mr. Mom is
          not a loss of male pride. A man’s dignity is not determined
          by his wife's moral transgressions. A man’s judgment is not compromised
          when he appoints a young female to run his self-defence academy.<br>
          <br>
          This is the new, non-judgmental masculinity our world deserves. It is
          the masculinity worth embracing and aspiring towards.
