          I FIRST DISCOVERED film as a 25 year old art student in New York. It
          struck me then that film, the study of human drama in creative form,
          could be the ultimate medium of self-expression I was searching for.

            Having careered in many fields, from architecture and engineering to

            understanding and sculpting human behavior and emotions through storytelling.<br>
            <br>
            I used to be obsessed with the American indie thinking man’s sci-fi;
            films that commonly explored a what-if situation based on a scientific
            concept.<br>
            <br>

            SCREENWRITING, THE CONCEPTION of story and drama, has become for me a

            <br>
            Today, I find myself increasingly drawn to stories that are based on

        A COMPELLING MAIN character is a blessing for the writer, the actor, the
        director and the producer. A compelling main character drives the story
        forward in unexpected ways, even with the most insignificant action and
        the subtlest of behaviour. Compelling characters attract talent,
        audiences, investment and awards.

          After you populate your screenplay with plot and characters, the first

          These observations are not three adjectives that describe the character.
          Or lengthy descriptions involving profession, backstory and family
          background. Certainly not wardrobe preferences either. These are
          helpful. But they do not make for a compelling character. Instead,

          feature. Few writers are willing to share credit or relinquish creative
          control after this much work has been put into the screenplay. But
          I believe otherwise.

        <br>
        <p class = "para">
          For that, I usually involve a co-writer with a similar <i>why</i> but
          who comes from a different culture as the one the story is set in.
          This provides a perspective that I’m unaware of, thereby improving how
          the story will be received by other cultures.<br>
          <br>
          In the case of <a href="//scripts.rawnarrativ.es/Sheepwolf.html" style="color:inherit"><i>Sheepwolf,</i></a>
          my American co-writer Arlene provided the Western female perspective
          that I was largely oblivious to on a story about an Asian male protagonist.
          I likened our working relationship to the one that director Ang Lee
          had with his writer-producer James Schamus on <i>Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.</i>
          As the Chinese screenplay was being written in Taiwan, Lee would
          translate it into English and email it to Schamus in New York every
          night. By the following morning, Lee would receive the revised version
          from Schamus and translate it to Chinese. I believe this rigorous
          process helped garner its Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay.

          DRAFT TWO OF the screenplay is the product of co-writing. In the case
          of <i>Sheepwolf,</i> a complete rewrite that took Arlene and I two years.<br>
          <br>
          This draft would be sent to labs and producers for funding and
          hopefully, production. More changes are expected along the way. Some
          minor, some major. Until the project is green-lit and the screenplay
          makes its way to the shooting script  - the Final Draft. <i>Which may
          take an additional year. Maybe longer. Maybe never.</i><br>
          <br>
          I’ve once had the opposite experience of rushing into making a feature
          film. It took me a year to complete. But I spent a lifetime being
          dissatisfied with it. Life is much too long to indulge the ego's need
          for short term gratification.<br>
          <br>
          These days, a screenplay can easily take me three to five years to get
          from idea to Final Draft, with countless internal drafts in between
          where I get to experiment and exhaust possibilities.

              <br>
              By the 3rd century, the Roman Empire had grown so vast that emperor
              Diocletian recognized it wasn’t feasible to govern from Rome. So
              in 286, he divided the empire into two halves with the
              <!--Eastern Empire’s capital at Byzantium, later renamed
              Constantinople in 330 (modern day Istanbul) and the Western Empire
              governed from Milan with Rome as the ceremonial capital. The-->
              border between the two empires corresponding roughly with that
              separating modern day Eastern and Western Europe.<br>
              <br>
              While the Eastern Empire flourished, the Western Empire languished,
              eventually falling in 476 at the hands of the barbarian statesman
              Odoacer who deposed Romulus Augustulus, the last Roman emperor to
              rule the Western Empire. With the empire fallen, Western Europe
              continued to exist for the following centuries as numerous tribal
              kingdoms - Franks, Visigoths, Vandals, etc. Not long after, the
              Eastern Emperor Zeno dissolved the Western court and proclaimed
              himself the sole emperor of the Roman Empire.<br>

              In 797, Irene of Athens, mother of then Emperor Constantine VI,
              gouged out her son’s eyes, leading to his death. She would then
              proclaim herself the sole ruler of the Roman Empire as she
              continued to rule from Constantinople (modern day Istanbul).<br>
              <br>
              The unprecedented status of a female ruler led Pope Leo III in Rome to
              crown the Frankish king Charlemagne as <i>“Emperor of the Romans”</i>
              in an attempt to revive the Western Roman Empire. In 800, a new
              empire in Western Europe emerged. The Holy Roman Empire. A name
              that overshadows its eastern counterpart, henceforth known as the
              Byzantine Empire.

              When an individual other than the church anoints someone, it does not
              carry the same symbolic meaning. Because the Church is an authority
              highly regarded by its followers.<br>
              <br>
              Hence, <b>Church</b> refers to an individual or organization highly
              regarded by your audience that gives you <i>split-second credibility</i>
              and legitimacy when you can show their <i>endorsement</i> of you.
              Opportunists like Charlemagne go so far as to create their own
              <b>Church</b> by making Pope Leo III legitimize him as the first
              emperor of the Holy Roman Empire.<br>
              <br>
              On the other hand, because the nature of <b>Church</b> is symbolic

            SCREENWRITING TEACHER JACOB Krueger often gives advice to emerging
            screenwriters alluding to an <i>Art vs Craft</i> discussion. He
            observes many emerging writers attempting to write whatever the
            market or Hollywood is looking for. Trends that will pass by the
            time they are finished writing. Unfortunately, the likelihood of
            their screenplays being produced is abysmally low. Simply because

              <br>
              Therefore Krueger believes that instead of writing for the market,
              emerging screenwriters should focus on telling stories from the heart.
              Writing that connects with their instincts. Their identity. Their

              Where Art and Craft demonstrate the prowess of the creator,

              FUNDAMENTAL TO ALL screenplays is its ability to entertain and to

              FULFILLMENT IS GAINED from the pursuit of purpose. A <i>long term

              <br>
              A multi-millionaire friend who devoted his life to an incredibly

              $8 million. He believed that the <i>sense of achievement</i> would
              give her the confidence she needs in life.<br>
              <br>
              This struck me as ironic and bizarre. Unlike immutable laws of
              physics, doesn't it sound ludicrous that an arbitary figure such
              as an additional $2 million can give you the confidence you need?
              Yet how many of us have a similar practice of keeping our own
              arbitrary figures in our heads that would meet some peculiar need?

        THERE WAS A time when my life revolved around crewing on film sets. The
        love for filmmaking started out with the act of making films.<br>
        <br>
        <i>I figured out <b>what</b> I was passionate about.</i>

          As the years passed, I realized that filmmaking was about storytelling.
          And it all began, ironically, outside the film set. In the writer’s
          seat.<br>
          <br>
          <i>I figured out <b>how</b> to go about fulfilling what I was
            passionate about.</i><br>
          <br>
          After making a few films and not totally loving it, it occurred to me
          that it didn’t matter if I could write and direct well. I was given a
          megaphone but I had no voice.<br>
          <br>
          <i>I couldn’t figure out <b>why</b> I was making films. I didn't know

          BEFORE FILM, I had given up on many things in life. Somehow, I
          couldn't seem to give up on film. Film was my art. <i>Art was my
          cause.</i> Serving that cause gave my life purpose.<br>
          <br>
          I was adamant that if I had to give up something, it was my
          relationships, including my marriage, in service of my art.<br>
          <br>
          At the turning point of my life, it hit me hard when I lost someone close
          to cancer. It struck me then that it wasn't about giving up anything.
          It was simply about giving. <i>Giving more of myself.</i><br>

          The beauty of true stories lies in the vagaries of life, where motives

          reflection of the morally ambiguous world we inhabit. And knowing my
          subjects intimately in real life ensures that they'll never appear
          out of character on the page. Which ironically is also the burden of
          true stories. Especially when the slavish pursuit of the truth

          FACEBOOK COO SHERYL Sandberg shares in her book <i>Lean In</i> that

          with the implication that their skills will help the company. Which
          explains why she was thoroughly impressed when Lori Goler who applied
          to work at Facebook asked the million dollar question, <i>“What is
          your biggest problem, and how can I solve it?”</i>

            Take a moment to imagine that you’re having a conversation with
            someone you potentially want to work or collaborate with. The first
            question you want to be <b>listening</b> for is <i>“What’s your
            biggest problem?”</i> or <i>“What’s your biggest aspiration?”</i><br>
            <br>
            Have this question at the back of your mind. The answer would surface
            naturally during the conversation. By listening for the other person’s
            biggest problem or biggest aspiration, you now possess the key to
            <b>unlock value</b> for this person. Why is this important? Because…

            Different enough to connect the dots for your audience.<br>

            Framing is asking yourself the second question, <i>“How can I
            <b>help</b> to solve it?”</i> or <i>“How can I <b>help</b> you attain it?”</i>
            The difference between this version and Goler’s is the word <i>help.</i>
            Because it’s rarely likely that you have the relevant skill sets to
            solve the other person’s problem entirely. But you can likely play a

          WHY NOT A sentence? Or three words? Having a single word forces you to
          boil the essence of what you stand for to something simple. Graspable.
          Memorable. It comes in handy especially when you're recalling the One
          Words that those around you stand for.<br>
          <br>
          Once in a while, there's an exception to this. A friend of mine wasn't
          fond of studying when he was a kid. He got into the worst schools and
          would've been destined to be a bottom feeder. His mother sent him abroad
          to study. Faced with hardship in a foreign environment, it transformed
          him into a diligent man who later carved an excellent career for himself.
          Today, he helps ex-convicts adjust to life outside of prison. His One
          Word is <i>not</i> DILIGENCE. It's SECOND CHANCE.

        DO YOU HAVE 5 people in your life you can turn to, <b>whose perspectives
        you value,</b> within 48 hours of encountering a crisis?
      <p>

      <p class="para collapse" id="collapseWizards" aria-expanded="false">
        Are your 5 wizards <i>wired differently enough</i> from you, and from
        one another, such that their perspectives work in concert to illuminate
        your blind spots <b>holistically?</b><br>
        <br>
        Wizards <i>don't</i> have to be mentors or coaches. But they
        <b>shouldn't</b> be your father figure. You want a distinctive voice
        you trust. <i>Not the default voice you revere.</i> For some, their
        children are their wizards.<br>
        <br>
        Wizarding, unlike mentoring or coaching, is a two way street. <i>You can
        be a wizard to someone who's your wizard.</i> It's not about getting
        advice from a sage. Not about obtaining consensus. It's about variety.
        Because <i>variety induces holism.</i><br>
        <br>
        Who you choose to be your wizards is absolutely critical. So limit
        those voices to 5. Most would have trouble identifying 3. View each
        crisis as an opportunity to reinvent yourself when you consult your
        wizards, and when you are <i>someone else's</i> wizard. The desired
        outcome is <b>a lighter, enlightened mind.</b><br>

          Judgmental behaviour, as the term implies, doesn’t have to be verbal.
          It doesn’t even require the subject to be present. In fact, judgments
          form the basis of discrimination, racial or otherwise. The chief

        A TITLE IS like a movie trailer. Instead of two minutes you have <b>one
        second</b> to hook them. With your audience in mind, consider the
        following:<br>
        <br><i>
        1. Does the content of your title <b>matter</b> to your audience?<br>

        2. Does your title sound <b>sexy, compelling or dramatic</b> to your audience?<br>

          STRICTLY SPEAKING, <i>“AMBASSADOR”</i> refers to a diplomatic official

          familiar to your audience that it fails to capture anyone's attention.<br>
          <br>
          On the other hand, your audience probably understands <i>“ambassador”</i>
          to mean someone so fervently supportive of you that they'd readily
          recommend you to friends and family. C'mon, there's no denying it

          Imagine being lured to a movie that doesn’t feel like what

        PERHAPS THE MOST significant element in all great films that touch, move

          To see this powerful concept executed in screenwriting, a highly driven
          character (e.g. an entrepreneur) begins his journey with an objective -
          a notion of what he <b><i>wants.</i></b> He is undeterred from his
          goal. The audience roots for him because of his determination.<br>
          <br>
          By the end of his journey, he arrives at an <i>unexpected yet
          inevitable</i> conclusion that what he <b><i>wants</i></b> no longer
          matters. Instead he discovers what he <b><i>needs.</i></b> Usually
          something that fills an obvious emotional void. This bitter-sweet
          moment can be so unforgettable for the audience that it has the
          capacity to change lives.

          HERE'S A TRUE story. I was working on the screenplays of two
          <a href="#TrueStories" style="color:inherit">true stories</a>
          when I found out that my partner was stricken with terminal cancer.
          It was a rare form of cancer that showed few external signs of
          debilitation. I took it for granted that she had a few more years.<br>
          <br>
          Given the extreme difficulties of getting a film produced, I plowed
          on my screenplay tirelessly, prioritizing art over love. Despite her
          pleas, I took off for a month to co-write with my writing partner in
          Los Angeles.<br>
          <br>
          When I returned, I was shocked to find her body muscles have atrophied
          beyond belief. Her condition declined rapidly thereafter. In a few
          months, I was overcame with shock when she could no longer recognise
          me. Shortly after, she passed on.<br>
          <br>
          <i>Could I not have waited a year to make my trip to LA?</i><br>
          <br>
          Unfortunately that was all hindsight. What I <b><i>wanted</i></b>
          badly was to complete my screenplay. Call it Art. Ambition.
          Achievement. What I <b><i>needed</i></b> most was compassion.
          Regrettably, I learnt it the hard way and bore the brunt of a painful,
          irreversible transformation.<br>

          <i>Apple</i> and <i>Virgin</i> are grounded in their <b>cause</b> of

          His first attempt to launch a manned flight to space was on 15 May 2018
          from Alice Springs, Australia.<br>
          <br>
          In the days leading to the launch, Singapore’s first astronaut was
          revealed. Volunteers along with their family members and a news crew
          from Singapore showed up in the remote desert to show their support.
          Unfortunately, winter came early that year. Winds were too strong for
          a safe liftoff. Everyone went home with a heavy heart when <i>we
          failed to launch.</i> <br>
          <br>
          A year later, the team of volunteers and news crew reconvened in Alice
          Springs for the second attempt on 26 April 2019. Only this time, the
          team was smaller. Weather conditions were favourable leading up to the
          launch date. But owing to malfunctioning navigation equipment,
          once again, <i>we failed to launch.</i><br>

          CONSIDERING THE CONSEQUENCE of failure for most startups rarely
          places a human’s life in harm’s way, Lim Seng has been rightfully
          prudent for safety reasons. However, patience was running thin amongst
          his volunteers. With two failed attempts to launch and social media
          deriding it as a scam, the <b><i>raison d'être</i></b> of the project
          and his credibility as <b><i>a man of action</i></b> were now being tested.<br>

          As it turns out, <i>safety</i> in a rarely attempted endeavour such as
          this can be a constant moving target. Within a fortnight, Lim Seng
          rallied his troops with the promise that he would launch on 31 May 2019.
          Earnestly reaching out to every volunteer, he assembled a skeletal
          crew of nine for his third attempt. I was one of them, assigned to
          play an integral role in operations.<br>
          <br>
          A day prior to the launch, Lim Seng announced the inevitable. Given
          the risks involved, the most responsible course of action as campaign
          director was for him, the man who funded the venture and who engineered
          the spacecraft, to assume the role of astronaut provided he deemed it
          <i>safe enough</i> for launch. To him, it was. Finally,<br>

          AS THE LAUNCH kicked into high gear, unlike previous unmanned launches,
          every action from inflating the stratospheric ballon to stabilizing the
          spacecraft had tremendous consequence if gone wrong. <i>Simply because
          the stakes were so bloody high.</i> The payload wasn't a piece of test
          equipment. It was a living breathing human being! Who must return to

          <br>
          Murphy’s law <i>“anything can go wrong will go wrong”</i> interfered

          <br>
          No one on the ground had an inkling if Lim Seng was alive for two
          harrowing hours since liftoff till search & rescue found him intact

        HAVING WORKED WITH several co-writers and developers from the US and UK,
        none have been as transformative as my experience co-writing with Arlene
        on the Singaporean film
        <a href="//scripts.rawnarrativ.es/Sheepwolf.html" style="color:inherit"><i>Sheepwolf.</i></a>
      </p>
      <div class="collapse" id="collapseCo-writing" aria-expanded="false">
        <p class ="para">
          Based on a <a href="#TrueStories" style="color:inherit">true story</a>
          that took place in Singapore, <i>Sheepwolf</i> is about a man, Chye,
          who after his brother's street murder, discovers his life’s calling,
          founding Southeast Asia’s largest self-defence movement to empower women, least
          expecting the day he would save his daughter from her own mother.<br>
          <br>
          Arlene is a first generation American writer-director based in Los
          Angeles. Because her mother survived WWII and the Gulag camps in
          Siberia before migrating to America, the theme of survival in
          <i>Sheepwolf</i> resonated with her.<br>
          <br>
          I invited Arlene to co-write <i>Sheepwolf</i> because I knew her to
          be an ardent supporter of women’s interests. A story about female
          empowerment via self-defence could benefit greatly from her voice.
          Together we explored themes of abuse and racism, using Chye’s
          experiences in 1980s Australia to critique the toxic masculine culture
          prevalent in contemporary American society.

        <br>
        <p class="firstpara">
          BECAUSE I KNOW Chye well in person, there’s always a subconscious
          impulse to favour an accurate portrayal of his character over being
          authentic to the spirit of the story.<br>
          <br>
          Chye had one personality anomaly I was particularly drawn to. On the one
          hand, he made it his life’s mission to empower women. On the other,
          as a result of his acrimonious divorce, he developed a mistrust for
          women when it came to romance. Arlene was adamant about not showing
          Chye’s misogynistic side. It seemed bizarre to me that

          The stuff that our pure fiction screenwriter colleagues would kill for.
          A role that actors would die for. The more I justified my grounds, the
          more Arlene felt that I wasn’t being sensitive towards the female
          audience. That she would have no part to play in a film that promoted
          misogyny.<br>
          <br>
          In that moment, her reaction reminded me of how offensive Mickey
          Rooney’s caricatural portrayal of Mr. Yunioshi was in the famous
          1961 film <i>Breakfast at Tiffany’s.</i><br>

          <br>
          It struck me then that to unintentionally include misogynistic
          references in <i>Sheepwolf</i> would be as offensive as “yellowface”
          -  a controversial Hollywood tradition of casting white actors as Asians.
          Both were discrimination.

          WE DEVELOPED THE understanding that just as I may never fully discern
          discrimination against women, Arlene may never fully discern
          discrimination against Asians. This meant that our collaboration
          ensured that we have each other’s blind spots covered. But only if we
          created a <b>safe environment</b> in which <b>polarizing views</b> can
          be expressed freely.<br>
          <br>
          Most importantly, just as <i>Breakfast at Tiffany’s</i> is not a film
          about racism, <i>Sheepwolf</i> is not a film about misogyny. It's a
          film about survival. In serving that theme, we've chosen to <b>selectively
          idealize</b> the main character.<br>
          <br>
          The challenge for screenwriters lies not merely in carefully choosing

          But why? If failure denotes the beginning of success, why are we ready
          to embrace the pariah in a failed business but not in a failed marriage?<br>
          <br>
          Realistically speaking, doesn't the endless hours that founders devote
          to their startups take a toll on their families' well-being and finances?
          If startup founders are more prone to divorce, why are we more
          forgiving towards their business failures than their marital failures?<br>

          of a family giving their unwavering support to the founder even
          when funds for the children’s education are at stake? Startup founders are more prone to divorce.-->

          If we're to inspire a healthy mindset towards failure for the next

        IN SIR THOMAS More's 1516 socio-political satire <i>Utopia,</i> the
        eponymous fictional state is painted as a place of perfection in law and
        order. In Utopia, possession of gold is frowned upon, going so far as

          The unquestionable priority for the average 30 year old Singaporean is
          to purchase property. Because ownership of property is widely perceived
          as the safest form of preserving one’s nest egg. Property has become the
          default choice of parking one’s money. Property has become <i>"silos
          of wealth."</i> Extrapolating this phenomena in land scarce Singapore
          inevitably leads the country to be in danger of becoming <b>a nation

          Recognizing this, the government taxes ownership of additional properties.
          Being the nation’s largest land banker, it controls the supply of its
          leasehold land. Apart from a meager 17% freehold land, most properties
          are 99 years leasehold. This antiquated legacy of British colonial

          every square foot counts. Including the ledge that the A/C compressor
          sits on! This unhealthy obsession on the property’s tenure and its psf

        AFTER CHECKING OUT many customized picture frames in a mall that
        specializes in custom frames, my girlfriend and I came across the only
        store that sold ready-made ones. Impressed by their quaint artistic
        decor, fast turnaround and premium-looking frames that cost a fraction
        of their custom cousins, we paid them to reprint and frame our pictures.
        Walking away with what seemed like a great deal, we returned an hour
        later for collection of the finished product. Whereupon I noticed to my
        dismay, one of their ready-made frames had an IKEA product tag.<br>
      </p>
      <font color="#000000">
      <h6 class="tagline">
        My impression of what they stood for crumbled. Instantly.</h6>

      <div class="collapse" id="collapseIntegrity" aria-expanded="false">
        <p class="para">
          I singled out the framer and demanded to know if the frames we bought
          were from IKEA. Caught by surprise, he looked at the manager. Then
          claimed he wasn’t aware since it was the boss who got them. Meanwhile,
          my girlfriend looked up IKEA’s website and asked to reconfirm the size
          of the frame we paid for. The room went silent. Tension mounted as
          they saw us learn of the vast difference we overpaid.<br>
          <br>
          In a desperate attempt to contain the situation, the manager promptly
          volunteered to refund our payment for the frames. Which did little to
          placate my nerves. She later reflected the owner’s views, who
          justified that it was normal business practice to mark up items in
          order to cover operating expenses. Which I do <i>not</i> disagree. But
          that was never the point. In fact, <i>never</i> once did I mention I
          was overcharged or that I wanted my money back.

          Integrity is subjective. Nevertheless, if the integrity of what you

        DURING MY TRAINING as an architecture student at Cooper Union, I was
        privileged to have world renowned architects as professors. I admired
        their strong personalities, their ability to bulldoze their opinions
        through critiques such that lesser professors constantly deferred
        politically to the top dog. As top dog, their outsized egos allowed
        them to
        <!--, we had to verbally defend
        our ideas during grueling critiques. You would imagine that <i>having an
        opinion</i> about why you do the things you do matter in this regard.<br>
        <br>
        But when your professors are renowned architects with supersized egos,
        you quickly realize that your opinion doesn’t count. These professors had
        strong personalities and were never shy of speaking their minds.-->

          One even went so far as saying, <i>“I can teach you everything about

          created by virtue of an artist's self-expression. He was referring to
          cultivating a strong personality.<br>

          To the impressionable twenty year old, it appeared that possessing an
          ego that left little room for others to voice their opinions were the
          hallmarks of a successful architect. But

          I USED TO think that being critical and judgmental was a sign that I
          knew what I want. Or at least have the balls to stand for my views.
          That merely denotes the presence of a strong personality. I would
          discover later that it's an issue. Though not the strong personality
          per se. It's
          <!--especially if these views were emotionally charged (i.e. elicit an

          if my films
          were meant to elicit an emotional reaction from my audience, isn’t it
          only natural that the filmmaker behave likewise?<br>

          Consider the critical, judgmental, emotionally charged response

        <p class="para">
          Also consider the dismissive response <i>"What are your talking about?!
          You don't make sense at all!"</i> Could it be the listener's stubborn
          refusal to see things from the speaker's perspective simply because she
          lacks the patience to put herself in the shoes of others? Or that the
          opinions of others <i>simply don't matter?</i><br>
          <br>
          Critical and judgmental remarks are the quickest way to <i>disarm and

          Merely for their voices to be <i>heard and <b>acknowledged.</b></i><br>
          <br>
          Unfortunately, an impasse is when both parties enter defensive mode to
          protect their egos, making it hard to consider other possibilities.
          Possibilities proposed by strong personalities because they are viewed
          as authoritarians. Possibilities proposed by not-so-strong
          personalities because they are disrespected as doormats.

            refers to having the same values and the same spiritual goals.<br>
            <br>
            A possible origin for this phrase may be the term <i>“yoke”</i> - a
            device fitted on draft animals to make them work the fields. It is a
            symbol of oppression which the Outsider is familiar with but which the
            Mainstream may neither recognize nor comprehend. Because you
            <i>don’t know what you don’t know.</i><br>

            Consider artists, musicians and human rights advocates who

            doesn't take the time and effort to understand the Outsider’s <i>“yoke”,</i>
            the Outsider may feel marginalized and announces her doubts about an
            Outsider-Mainstreamer relationship.<br>
            <br>
            The Mainstreamer may blame the Outsider for not being open-minded.
            Naturally, the Outsider who has been yearning for <b>inclusivity</b>
            wants to believe she is open-minded. Unknowingly, she has become the
            target of "gaslighting" in a toxic relationship.

          SELF-DETERMINATION THEORY IS concerned with the motivation behind
          choices people make. And there are two kinds. Intrinsic motivation
          is about doing things or helping others purely because you like doing
          them. Extrinsic motivation is about doing things because you’ll get
          something in return.

            Psychologist Russ Harris created a simple exercise for us to

            <br>
            Imagine you are 80 years old (or pick an older age if you’re
            already 80). Then complete the sentences <i>“I wish I’d spent

            This is a surprisingly effective way of getting us to focus on doing

            the things that mattered most to me. Film.<br>

            EVER SINCE MY disillusionment and departure from a corporate world
            driven largely by extrinsic goals, I developed a vision -

            This naturally became my primary value: to serve others (intrinsic).

            portfolio he amassed over the years may have given him a sense of
            <i>achievement,</i> but not a sense of <i>fulfillment.</i> Not until
            he founded his self-defense movement to serve others.

            Film festivals, with their awards and recognition, celebrate the

            For instance, he wanted to become a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller.
            What he believed were important steps such as going to writers’
            conferences, reading a lot about writing, conducting focus groups,
            having media coverage or having famous people endorse his book,
            <i>all didn’t matter.</i><br>
            <br>
            Instead, he found out that all that mattered to become a <i>New York

            Using this method, he apparently took his book <i>The Millionaire

            THERE’S ONE PROBLEM with Burchard’s approach. It is designed to be

            <br>
            In <i>Destructive Goal Pursuit: The Mount Everest Disaster,</i>
            Chris Kayes recounts climbers so hell bent on achieving their goal
            of conquering the Mt Everest summit that the goal became a part of their
            <b>identity.</b> When presented with information that showed
            uncertainty about achieving their goals, it only made the climbers
            invest even more fiercely in their preferred vision of their future.
            In this desperate attempt to preserve their sense of identity, some
            end up losing their lives.<br>
            <br>
            To disregard this example because the rest of us pursue goals that
            are of much lower stakes would be missing the point. The nugget of
            wisdom to be gleaned, as Oliver Burkeman illustrates in <i>The

            In the movie, Neo takes the red pill once, becomes enlightened and
            eventually goes on to lead the rebellion against the Matrix. In real

            <br>
            Everyday, every decision we make that we <b>don’t question,</b> we’re
            unconsciously popping a blue pill - <i>applying a default solution
            to a default problem.</i> We’re saying to ourselves we prefer the
            status quo. Operating within our comfort zone. Because beyond that
            lies the unknown. And our fear of it. So most times, we survive by taking blue.<br>
            <br>
            If, however, just as we’re about to default to the standard solution,
            we imagine Morpheus appearing in front of us, presenting both pills…<br>

            Where blue grounds us in status quo, red launches us into the next

          </i><br>
            The downside exists. There's no avoiding it. It's likely greater
            than the downside of the blue pill. But we already know that. What
            we don't know is how much upside. And whether we're able to <i>reframe</i>
            our minds to <i>perceive and embrace the unknown upside.</i>

            Instead of waiting <i>passively</i> for challenges to show up in our lives,

            In fact, taking the red pill is what characters in movies do all the

            end up paying is <i>the price of conformity.</i><br>
            <br>
            When we pop the red pill, the downside is the drama. The upside is we

            Done often enough, when we encounter a crisis, our minds become adjusted,

            So has our appetite for risk.<br>

            Even when taking red becomes the default, it isn't automatically
            blue pill behavior. On the contrary, when our tolerance for unexpected

            <br>
            While his friends dish him the platitude, <i>"You deserve better,"</i>
            he reasons that relationships are about compromise. Hence, he gives

            CONSIDER THE SLOGAN of the 1789 French Revolution, <i>“Liberty.
            Equality. Fraternity.”</i> A significant turning point in the
            history of Western civilization and a cornerstone of modern Western
            society and its values. This has led to the development of welfare
            European nations’ egalitarian approach towards life.<br>
            <br>
            The pursuit of equality not only in terms of gender and class but
            also across occupations recognizes the importance of developing a
            holistic and humanistic society.<br>
            <br>
            This is in stark contrast with Asian countries where pragmatic
            professions such as banking thrive while artists are marginalized.
            Especially in tax havens such as Singapore and Hong Kong, the
            inadequacy of a fiscal mechanism to redistribute wealth leads to
            home prices becoming inflated and hence out of reach for artists.
            In the long run, this forces Asians to consider career choices not
            out of passion but out of pragmatism.<br>

                He knows he is wrongly convicted. He believes in his own
                innocence. Yet by this point, having already served 8 years, he
