        SINGAPORE, 1971. ELEVEN year old Chye, the youngest of three brothers in
        an impoverished family, huddles in a corner of his bed, helpless, as he
        hears his abusive father beating his fifteen year old brother Chuan for
        hanging out with gangs. The next day Chye asks his brother Chuan why they
        are not loved like their eldest brother. Chuan almost spills a family
        secret but instead tells him how to survive.<br>
        <br>
        When Chuan is arrested for possession of drugs, Chye’s father beats Chye’s
        mother for failing to keep a watchful eye on Chuan. Chye instinctively
        protects his mother by standing up to his father. Chye discovers Taekwondo
        and realizes it can help him protect his mother against his father, thus
        initiating his lifelong interest in martial arts.

          IN THE ’80S, Chye finds himself in a new world as a university student
          in Australia studying psychology. When he’s not getting static from
          casual, everyday racism or from violent attacks, he’s getting it from
          his fellow wealthier Singaporean schoolmates. To make ends meet, Chye
          takes on odd jobs involving hard labor which exposes him to racist
          attacks. Chye explores more practical martial arts techniques and his
          confidence grows as he finally learns to dispatch his attackers, but
          he is heartbroken when he cannot protect a friend from assault. Chye
          confides with a professor about the incident only to be sexually
          assaulted by the professor. Traumatized and ashamed at being helpless,
          Chye keeps the incident a secret.<br>
          <br>
          Chye excels in his studies and is offered a direct path to a PhD. Just
          as Chye develops a sense of belonging in Australia, his mother’s
          suicide attempt forces him to return to Singapore.

          BY THE EARLY '90s, Chye transforms himself to a successful corporate man.
          Within reach of the very top of the food chain and surrounded by
          materialistic wealth, Chye lacks love in his life. His family is under
          strain. His father continues to abuse his mother, and his brother
          Chuan is just getting out of prison. Chye enters a loveless marriage
          which he attempts to salvage by having a child. Chye abandons his
          corporate career to dedicate himself to raising his daughter, Nicole.
          For the first time in his life, he experiences love, unconditional
          love from his daughter. Not long after, his marriage ends with his
          ex-wife abandoning Chye and Nicole.

          IN THE YEAR 2000, Chye is a single father living a modest lifestyle
          with his daughter whilst counseling victims of sexual assault. Pained
          by society’s lack of protections for the victims, it dawns upon Chye
          that by combining his psychological and martial arts training, he can
          formulate a self-defense approach for the victims. He begins teaching
          these self-defense techniques to women. Tragedy strikes when Chye
          learns that his brother Chuan, after having suffered a savage street
          attack, falls into a coma. Helpless against the final chapter of his
          brother’s fate, Chye goes to Arizona to train with a recluse martial artist.<br>
          <br>
          As he undergoes his training in Arizona, Chye has an epiphany that
          pure martial art forms do not translate well into self-defense. In fact,
          true self-defense need only employ simple yet brutal techniques. Chye
          reveals his resolve to build a self-defense academy in memory of his
          brother Chuan and receives the blessing of his mentor.

          the one person he can’t live without. Chye’s psychological state starts

        THE CREATIVE VISION behind <i>Sheepwolf</i> is to provide a cinematic
        experience with an Asian lead while telling an intimate, idiosyncratic
        story with universal truths. <i>Sheepwolf</i> explores the themes of alienation
        and survival in an abusive world. The audience take away is empowerment
        and encouragement. A knowing, for some, that if you have been abused or
        traumatized, you are not alone. An inspiration and a call to courage for
        those who must break away from tradition and norms to find their own paths.
        And a validation for our common search for identity, love and belonging.

          <i>Sheepwolf</i> is about a traumatized outsider who forges his own path.
          Where most Singaporean films are contained in the context of Singapore
          culture, what drew me to Chye’s story was that it actively tests the
          Singaporean mentality when subjected to Western influence. It is a
          heart-breaking journey of self-discovery that spans the globe - set in
          Singapore, Australia, and the American Southwest. It features
          emotionally complex characters navigating through an abusive world and

        <p class = "para">
          The tone is that of despair with affirming moments of hope. Our film
          references include <i>Lion,</i> for its heartbreak and hope spanning
          two continents and cultural divides, <i>Minari</i> for its authentic
          exploration of cultural identity, <i>A Land Imagined,</i> for its
          unflinching look at alienation in modern Singapore through its underdogs,
          <i>Cold War,</i> for its organic portrayal of heartbreak and emotional
          storytelling in exploring love and freedom across borders, and
          <i>Never Look Away,</i> for its depiction of a life story in chapters
          showing a personal evolution to find one’s own agency.<br>
          <br>
          The visual style of <i>Sheepwolf</i> has a muted color palette, with
          the feeling that the characters have been living that story their
          entire lives and the camera just happened to be there,

          The master director of modern alienation is Michelangelo Antonioni,
          and his cinematic influence will inspire the visual language of
          <i>Sheepwolf</i> taking on Chye’s isolation in Singapore, Australia,
          and Arizona. To show the cognitive dissonance from trauma and its
          lasting effects, there will be moments with distorted visuals and sounds.

          We are inspired by Chye, how someone can go through abuse and emerge
          out of it, survive it, then help others. We are passionate about the
          opportunity to model the self-actualization of a man who decided to
          protect women from real-life monsters, how he got to that point is
          intriguing. We are excited <i>Sheepwolf</i> dares to explore a hard
          journey to personal fulfillment against the backdrops of scarcity and
          materialism. We are enthralled by the potential to make a multi-faceted,
          unique gem of a film.

        WHERE MOST SINGAPOREAN films are contained in the context of Singapore
        culture, what drew me to Chye’s story was that it actively tests the
        Singaporean mentality when subjected to Western influence. Not unlike
        Middle Eastern and Asian immigrants who settle in western cultures. But
        unlike them because in <i>Sheepwolf,</i> Chye is the bearer of western
        ideology when he returns to his home country.

        <!--I WAS INTIALLY intrigued by Chye’s story because it questioned the
        commonly held belief that martial arts is synonymous with self-defense.
        No one I knew had bothered to ask,
        BY THE END of my first meeting with Chye in Dec 2016, I knew this was
        someone I could work with, whose story I could see myself working on for
        the next 7 years. I completed my first draft in Jan 2018, which helped
        bring on board long time friend Arlene Bogna as co-writer. Through our
        collaboration, Arlene observed that…

          His divorce also struck a chord with me. I happened to be going through

          The previous century has seen the Asian male being typecast in

          AS WE DELVED deep into Chye’s life in Australia and how that impacted
          his decisions and values after his return to Singapore, it struck me

          Such a film had not been made. Something deep within me was crying out

          I hope the fact that <i>Sheepwolf</i> is based on a true story gives
