      <p class="firstpara">
        DURING A LIVE TV interview, former defense scientist Lim Seng announces
        that his team of volunteers will send the first Singaporean to space
        from Alice Springs, Australia on 15th May 2018. Chosen from over a
        hundred pilot candidates, the astronaut will ascend to the Armstrong
        line 20km above Earth in a space capsule with the help of a stratospheric
        balloon, following which a parachute would be deployed to bring him safely back to Earth.

          In the days leading up to the launch, over thirty volunteers comprising
          pilots and engineers gather at Alice Springs. The astronaut is revealed
          to be Major Yip, a F15 commander with the Air Force known by his call
          sign "Smash". As the team preps on the ground, a storm brews in the
          heavens above. This year, winter came early. With prevailing strong
          upper winds that threaten to rupture the balloon,

          A YEAR LATER, the volunteers descend on Alice Springs for the second
          launch attempt on 26 April 2019. Despite being under twenty strong,
          the team is ready and well prepared before the designated date. The
          weather turns out perfect two days prior. Unfortunately, a mandatory
          GPS device required by aviation authorities malfunctions. By the time
          the engineers resolve the issue,

        <p class = "para">
          While the rest of the team head back to Singapore, Lim Seng and a few
          engineers stay behind to prep for a third launch attempt in two weeks,
          on 7 May 2019. With the team down to a handful, the pilots are
          concerned that Lim Seng and his engineers’ eagerness to complete the
          mission may result in an oversight on safety measures. Due to the lack
          of favorable weather conditions and job commitments to attend to,
          Smash returns to Singapore.

        <br>
        <p class="firstpara">
          AS THIS NEW reality dawns on Lim Seng, he recognizes that part of the
          pilots’ insistence for perfect weather conditions stems from their
          exposure to high safety standards. When observing weather patterns,
          engineers are looking for reasons to launch. Whereas pilots, it seems,
          are looking for reasons <b>not</b> to launch.<br>
          <br>
          Identifying a new window of opportunity, Lim Seng rallies his troops
          for a fourth launch attempt in three weeks, on 31 May 2019. This new
          team, only nine strong, would consist mostly of inexperienced
          non-engineers. And no pilots. But this would do.<br>
          <br>
          Despite spending years to determine the right candidate, Lim Seng
          realizes he would be guilt-stricken for life should anything untoward
          happen to Smash during the mission. As the engineer who built the
          system from scratch,

          ON THE DAY of the launch, many blunders occur due to the team’s
          unfamiliarity with the process. But none prove particularly fatal.
          Except for a new safety procedure introduced a few hours before launch.
          This one minor modification would become the straw that breaks the
          camel's back; setting into motion a chain of calamitous events.<br>
          <br>
          Starting with the capsule crashing upon launch, its base gets violently
          ripped apart, spilling its mechanical guts in its wake. The debris
          reveals GPS, comms and crashables that ensure a safe landing. This means that

        <p class = "para">
          When the capsule reaches an altitude of 8km, the parachute is promptly
          deployed. Then search and rescue initiated. For two harrowing hours,
          the team is overcome with the dreadful thought of Lim Seng either
          paralyzed, or worse, dead on arrival.<br>
          <br>
          When Lim Seng is eventually found, it turns out the initial crash
          compromised both the integrity of the capsule as well as that of the
          space suit. If he ascended higher, he would likely perish from the
          lack of oxygen in the upper atmosphere. But luckily for Lim Seng, he
          survives the ordeal unscathed to recount his remarkable journey.

        THE SECOND THING I learned about a crazy Singaporean ambitious enough to
        send a man to space is that he was no longer in talks with a notable
        Singaporean filmmaker to turn his journey into a movie. Apparently, the
        filmmaker didn’t believe the <a href="//www.gospace.sg" style="color:inherit">GoSpace</a>
        project would succeed. To me,

          When we hear a story about a maverick scientist attempting to send a
          man to space in a homemade spacecraft, most people assume the scientist
          to be American. Or someone from a liberal democracy with a sizable
          population and vast expanses of land. Statistically speaking, the odds
          are higher in these countries of producing a genius, who happens to be
          a man of action, who also happens to have the financial wherewithal to pull it off.<br>
          <br>
          Few can imagine the existence of such a person in a tiny state like
          Singapore where the predominant religion practiced on a daily basis
          is <a href="//blog.rawnarrativ.es/#Pragmatism" style="color:inherit">pragmatism.</a><br>
          <br>
          Why? Isn’t Singapore known for being the tiny red dot that punches
          above its own weight? For being <i>successful</i> as the regional hub
          for finance, education, biomedical, etc? Herein lies the answer.

        <p class = "para">
          So obsessed are we about this that any endeavor with a high degree of
          uncertainty and failure accompanied by a lack of recognizable utility
          is neither encouraged nor supported. And if the endeavor meets with
          failure, it is best swept under the carpet, for fear of disgrace and
          embarassment.

          WHEN LIM SENG managed to launch but did not reach his target of the
          Armstrong line 20km above Earth, was it considered a success or
          failure? This was the question posed by ABC News during a post-launch
          interview. Perhaps another question worth exploring is,
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Is this story worth telling despite failing to reach the Armstrong Line?</i><br>
        </p>
        <p class = "para">
          We have indeed become a society that is mesmerized by a certain type
          of myth, that of the self-made trailblazer who charts her own path to
          success. To share a story of rags to riches feels reassuring for the
          storyteller. To share a story that embraces failure feels vulnerable.
          It risks being ridiculed. It invites judgment. But it may also inspire
          others on a similar path.<br>

        <p class="para">
          I want to tell it. And I want to be a part of it. Because the
          obsession with the markers of success is becoming a crippling disease
          in this tiny red dot. As Oliver Burkeman notes in his book <i>The
          Antidote,</i> when we are reluctant to analyze failure, it inevitably
          leads to a distorted picture of the causes of successes.

          IN ADDITION TO being an observer, I volunteered to assist Lim Seng in
          the launch. Both team members and outsiders have often assumed that for
          the sake of the film, it would've been ideal if Lim Seng reached the
          Armstrong line, an irrefutable indicator of success. That certainly
          translates to more bums on seats given society’s obsession with a
          success story.<br>
          <br>
          Personally, I feel that there's great merit witnessing the mini
          failures along the way: engineers often seem confident about the
          system after having solved a complex problem, only to encounter a
          different problem surfacing in a completely unexpected area. Such is
          the nature of <a href="//blog.rawnarrativ.es/#TrueStories" style="color:inherit">true stories,</a>
          where <i>problems constantly appear out of left field.</i><br>
          <br>
          The accumulation of these lessons leading to the final outcome serve
          to reinforce the <b>motto</b> of the mission as well as that of the film.

          extension of that mission to the rest of the world.

        IN 2019, ANTICIPATING the launch on 26 April 2019, we created the
        following video to reach out to our intended audience - <i>Rebels & Patriots.</i><br>
        <br>
        Current rebels include pilots, makers, inventors, entrepreneurs, TED
        organizers and artists. Potential rebels are risk-takers who associate
        themselves with our ideals.<br>
        <br>
        Patriots love their country. They want to see it thrive. To thrive is to
        evolve. To evolve, a nation must persevere. To persevere, the individual
        must take initiative.<br>
        <br>
        The <a href="//www.gospace.sg" style="color:inherit">GoSpace</a> project
        is <i>not</i> just about bringing a man in a capsule to the sky and back
        to Earth. That is purely an engineering feat. That is the <i>external
        problem.</i> The <b><i>what.</i></b> The GoSpace project is also
        about the need for Singaporeans to <i>evolve.</i> This is the <i>internal
